# Semiconductor Thin Film Data Analysis Web App

## Introduction

This web application is designed to help you analyze semiconductor thin film properties. It allows you to input data related to thin film samples, such as deposition voltage, deposition time, temperature, pH, and more. The application will then perform various data analysis processes to provide insights into both optical and electrical properties of the thin films.

Access the web app [here](https://semiconductor-thinfilm-data-visualization.streamlit.app).

## Analytical Processes

The web app employs several analytical processes to generate the final results:

### Data Input
- Users can input data for multiple thin film samples, including sample ID, deposition voltage, deposition time, temperature, pH, molar mass, density, n-value, current, area, and P.E.C signal.

### Data Exploration and Analysis
- Basic data exploration analysis is performed, and additional columns are calculated, such as average current density, thickness (in cm and nm), and PEC signal in mV.

### Text File Conversion
- Users can upload text files from UV-spectrophotometers, which are then converted to Excel format for analysis.

### Optical Properties Analysis
- Optical properties such as absorbance, transmittance, reflectance, absorption coefficient, refractive index, extinction coefficient, optical conductivity, and dielectric constant are calculated from the UV/VIS spectrophotometer data.

### Electrical Properties Analysis
- Electrical properties including thickness and current density are analyzed based on user-provided data.

## Downloadable Datasets

The web app provides the following downloadable datasets:
- Optical Thin Film Dataset
- Electrical Thin Film Dataset
- Complete Thin Film Dataset

## Visualizations

Users can create customized line graphs to visualize data by selecting X and Y-axis columns. The app offers options to adjust axis values for better visualization.
